            The goal of this Development project was to create a list of items
            similar to an online store or list maker with sorting, filtering,
            and an aggregator like a cart or favorites list.

            I did a competitive analysis on three companies who all had features
            that I thought about either implementing or improving on in my own
            project.
          </p>

            I decided to create a Hike To-Do List Maker since it combines my
            large passion of the outdoors with the objectives of the project.

              I chose <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>,
              <a href="https://kuhl.com">Kuhl</a>, and
              <a href="https://alltrails.com">All Trails</a> to do my
              competitive analysis on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found that AllTrails definitely had a very appealing filtering
              system, with a map on the right side of the screen to show exactly
              where each hike on my favorites list was. It also had a plethora
              of filtering options. Not being able to sort the hikes was an
              unfortunate downside, as being able to sort by longest to shortest
              or highest to lowest would be nice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kuhl had a nice visual design, but it was lacking many features
              that one would want out of a shopping cart, as there was no way to
              filter OR sort the items. However, navigating the items/removing
              items was a very easy task and the simplified and streamlined
              interface was nice to use.
            </p>

              Finally, Spotify does a lot right since they have an extremely
              large team behind them. They include a lot of sorting options and
              even make it so you can create custom orders for songs. The one
              thing they were missing was any sort of filtering system, whether
              it be black or whitelisting. I would like to see that in the
              future from Spotify.

        For my interface, I wanted to have a system that sorts, filters, and
        removes mountains/hikes like Alltrails does, but I would like to focus
        on more information about the hikes themselves and less on the overall
        map of all the hikes, as it can seem crowded and hard to read. I want to
        create a to-do list of hikes on the side and in the middle would be all
        of the available hikes, with the ability to add or remove from the to-do
        list, sort by length or height (both high to low and low to high),
        filter by difficulty or state, or both, clear to-do list, and reset
        filters/sorts

              I implemented the filtering and sorting on the hike cards and they
              can compound on each other, for example, a user can sort from
              highest to lowest height, as well as only hikes from New Hampshire
              rated Hard.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the user adds a hike to the to-do list, it will remove it
              from the main selection area and place it in the to-do list. The
              card will now show a remove button instead of an add button. This
              is because I don't believe it makes sense to add a specific
              mountain more than once.

              I also added a search bar, a collapsable to-do, and other
              responsive elements on top of the filtering, sorting, and
              aggregating to the website to further solidify both design and

              I also made sure to have the to-do list display items in the order
